## swift-libedit

Example swift command line app that shows how to link libedit for better line editing and command history.

### Note

The built-in Xcode console is broken and won't work with this out of the box.
The included scheme should be set correctly, but if you have trouble edit the scheme, select Run, select Options, and switch the Console setting from Xcode to Terminal.
